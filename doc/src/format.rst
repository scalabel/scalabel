Scalabel Format
--------------------------

Scalabel format defines the protocol for importing image lists with optional
:ref:`automatic labels<Auto Label>` and exporting the manual annotations. This
is also the format for `BDD100K dataset
<https://www.bdd100k.com>`_.

Schema of the format is shown below. You can also use our `Typescript
<https://github.com/scalabel/scalabel/blob/master/app/src/types/export.ts>`_
and Python type definitions. Most of the fields are optional depending
on your purpose. If you only want to upload a list of images when creating a
project, you only need ``url``. ``videoName`` is used to group frames for each
tracking task. If you are annotating bounding boxes, you can ignore `poly2d` and
other label types.

``Item List``, ``Categories``, ``Attributes`` can be uploaded with separate
files. Or they could be contained in a single file, following the exporting format.

Exporting Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exporting format has the following fields.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - frames [ ]:
        - item001
        - item002
        ...
    - config:
        - image_size: (optional, valid when all images have the same size)
            - width: int
            - height: int
        - attributes [ ]:
            - name: string
            - toolType: string (can be 'switch' or 'list')
            - tagText: string (acronym when showing)
            - values: string[]
            - tagPrefix: string
        - categories: string[]

Each item in the ``frame`` field is an image with several fields.
``attributes``, ``categories`` are the list of tags given
to each label in images. Fields of item are given below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: string (must be unique over the whole dataset!)
    - url: string (relative path or URL to data file)

            - dimension: (3D point, height, width, length)
        - poly2d:
            - vertices: [][]float (list of 2-tuples [x, y])
            - types: string
            - closed: boolean
        - rle:
            - counts: str
            - size: (height, width)
        - graph: (optional)
            - nodes [ ]:
                - location: [x, y] or [x, y, z]
                - category: string
                - visibility: string (optional)
                - type: string (optional)
                - score: float (optional)
                - id: string
            - edges [ ]:
                - source: string
                - target: string
                - type: string (optional)
            - type: string (optional)


More details about the fields

* name / videoName / url
    * When there is no url the data folder structure is assumed to be:
        * <data_root>/videoName (if any)/name
    * If your data folder structure differs from that, you can store the relative path from <data_root> to the data file in url.
    * Note that 'name' must be unique over the whole dataset, s.t. ``frameGroup`` can refer to each frame via its name.
* labels

    * index: index of the label in an image or a video
    * manualShape: whether the shape of the label is created or modified manually
    * manualAttributes: whether the attribute of the label is created or
      modified manually
    * score: the confidence or some other ways of measuring the quality of the label.
    * box3d - follows the convention in the KITTI dataset.
        * alpha: observation angle if there is a 2D view
        * location: 3D center of the box, stored as 3D point in camera coordinates, meaning the axes (x,y,z) point right, down, and forward.
        * orientation: 3D orientation of the bounding box, stored as axis angles in the same coordinate frame as the location.
        * dimension: 3D box size, with length in x direction, height in y direction and width in z direction

    * poly2d

        * types: Each character corresponds to the type of the vertex with the
          same index in vertices. ‘L’ for vertex and ‘C’ for control point of a
          bezier curve.
        * closed: true for polygon and otherwise for path

    * graph

        * nodes
            * location: 2D or 3D coordinates. In 2D: (x, y), x horizontal, y vertical, (0, 0) top left corner.
            * category: Either joint name or type of segmentation (see closed in `poly2d`).
            * visibility: Visibility of joint for pose.
            * type: Type of vertex for segmentation (see type in `poly2d`).
            * score: Confidence score during prediction.
            * id: Unique ID.

        * edges
            * source: Unique ID of the source node of the edge.
            * target: Unique ID of the target node of the edge.
            * type: Type of edge.

        * type: Specification of graph.


If your dataset contains multiple data sources (e.g. multiple cameras or other sensors), you can group frames together using ``frameGroup``.
This data structure inherits from ``frame``, s.t. each  ``frameGroup`` has all of the attributes above, plus a list of frame names that are assigned to the group:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - [inherits all attributes from frame]
    - frames: [ ]str (list of frame names in the group)

KITTI Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The KITTI Velodyne dataset contains a pointcloud file (``.bin``) and four corresponding image files (``.png``).
Currently, Scalabel only supports ``.ply`` files for pointclouds. Please refer to
`this script
<https://gist.github.com/HTLife/e8f1c4ff1737710e34258ef965b48344>`_ for conversion purposes.

The data structure is similar to that used by ``frameGroup`` above, where the frame names consist of the pointcloud and the four corresponding images.

You can have a quick try by submitting the relevant files in
`examples/kitti
<https://github.com/scalabel/scalabel/blob/master/examples/kitti>`_
and choose Point Cloud  in ``Item Type`` and 3D Bounding Box in ``Label Type``.

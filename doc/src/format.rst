Scalabel Format
--------------------------

Scalabel format defines the protocol for importing image lists with optional
:ref:`automatic labels<Auto Label>` and exporting the manual annotations. This
is also the format for `BDD100K dataset
<https://www.bdd100k.com>`_.

Schema of the format is shown below. You can also use our `Typescript
<https://github.com/scalabel/scalabel/blob/master/app/src/types/export.ts>`_
and Python type definitions. Most of the fields are optional depending
on your purpose. If you only want to upload a list of images when creating a
project, you only need ``url``. ``videoName`` is used to group frames for each
tracking task. If you are annotating bounding boxes, you can ignore `poly2d` and
other label types.

More details about the fields

* labels

    * manualShape: whether the shape of the label is created or modified manually
    * manualAttributes: whether the attribute of the label is created or
      modified manually
    * score: the confidence or some other ways of measuring the quality of the label.
    * box3d

        * alpha: observation angle if there is a 2D view
        * orientation: 3D orientation of the bounding box, used for 3D point
          cloud annotation
        * locatoin: 3D point, x, y, z, center of the box
        * dimension: 3D box size
    
    * poly2d

        * types: Each character corresponds to the type of the vertex with the 
          same index in vertices. ‘L’ for vertex and ‘C’ for control point of a
          bezier curve.
        * closed: true for polygon and otherwise for path

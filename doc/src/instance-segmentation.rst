2D Instance Segmentation
--------------------------

Annotating instance segmentation involves drawing polygons. Simply click on the
image to start a label, and close the path to finish drawing. Click on the
boundary to select the label.

Dragging the midpoint on an edge turns the midpoint into a vertex. Click the
midpoint of an edge while pressing ``c`` makes the edge a bezier curve. You can
adjust the control points to get tight-fitting curves. To revert back to a
normal edge, click on a control point while pressing ``c``.

   Drawing a segmentation label

Sometimes an instance can be divided into multiple parts in the image due to
occlusion. To link different polygons, first press ``Ctrl`` (``Cmd``) to select
polygons you want to link, then press ``l`` (lowercase) to link these selected
polygons. Press ``L`` (uppercase) to unlink the label.

   Linking and unlinking segmentation labels

We also support vertex deletion. To delete a vertex from a drawn polygon, press
``d`` first, and then click on the control point you want to delete. The second
way to use vertex deletion is when drawing a new polygon. When the drawing is
not finished, press ``d`` could delete previous drawn vertex.

   Deleting vertex

.. TODO: This is not supported now.
.. Segmentation labels often share borders with each other. To make segmentation
.. annotation more convenient, Scalabel supports vertex and edge sharing. When
.. drawing a segmentation label, adding a new vertex at the position of an existing
.. vertex shares the reference of the two vertices. The edge between two vertices
.. that are both shared by two segmentation labels will also be shared. When
.. adjusting a vertex or an edge with shared reference, all segmentation labels
.. involved will be changed accordingly.

.. Quick Draw is a useful tool for border sharing. When drawing a segmentation label that needs to share a border with an existing label,
.. press ``Ctrl-D`` (``Cmd-D`` for Mac users) or the ``Quick Draw`` button to start Quick Draw mode. First select a polygon to share the
.. border with, and then select the starting vertex and the ending vertex of the shared border. Press ``Alt`` to toggle between two
.. possible shared paths. Hit ``Enter`` to end Quick Draw.

.. To delete a single vertex, click on the vertex while pressing ``d``. When drawing a segmentation label in progress, pressing ``d``
.. deletes the last vertex drawn on the image.

Lane Marking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lane marking is similar to segmentation labeling, except that the path is not
closed. Hit ``Enter`` to finish drawing a label.

Drivable Area
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly as other instance segmentation tasks, you can annotate the
drivable area in the image. Details about the drivable area can be found
in this `blog <http://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/05/30/bdd/>`_.
